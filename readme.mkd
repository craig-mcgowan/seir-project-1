This trivia game is intended to be a fun way to practice building and deploying
an interactive website and using an AJAX request to connect to an API.

It's also got fun computer science trivia for beginners, as well as a few easter eggs just so I could get extra practice coding.

I used bootstrap for the styling on the buttons and progress bar and google fonts for the header and scoreboard.

Would love to add some lifelines, the option to play single player and a start over button in the future.
